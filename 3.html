<p>
Na Hyeseok (Korean: 나혜석; Hanja: 羅蕙錫, 28 April 1896 – 10 December 1948) was a Korean feminist, poet, writer, painter, educator, and journalist.[1] Her pen name was Jeongwol (Hangul: 정월, 晶月).[2] She was a pioneering Korean feminist writer and painter. She was the first female professional painter and the first feminist writer in Korea.[3] She created some of the earliest Western-style paintings in Korea, and published feminist novels and short stories.[4][5] She became well known as a feminist with her criticism against the marital institution in the early 20th century.</p>

In 2013 and 2014, Park ranked 11th on the Forbes list of the world's 100 most powerful women and the most powerful woman in East Asia.[3] In 2014, she ranked 46th on the Forbes list of the world's most powerful people, the third-highest South Korean on the list, after Lee Kun-hee and Lee Jae-yong.
On 9 December 2016, the National Assembly impeached Park on charges related to influence peddling by her top aide, Choi Soon-sil.[4] Then-Prime Minister Hwang Kyo-ahn assumed her powers and duties as Acting President as a result.[5] The Constitutional Court upheld the impeachment by a unanimous 8/0 ruling on 10 March 2017, thereby removing Park from office.[6]
On 6 April 2018, South Korean courts sentenced Park to 24 years in prison which was later increased to 25 years.[7][8] Park is currently imprisoned at Seoul Detention Center.</p>
