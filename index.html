<h1>WOMYN</h1>
<p>
The word womyn is one of several alternative spellings of the English word women used by some feminists.[1] There are other spellings, including womban (a reference to the womb) or womon (singular), and wimmin (plural). Some writers who use such alternative spellings, avoiding the suffix "-man" or "-men", see them as an expression of female independence and a repudiation of traditions that define women by reference to a male norm.[2] Recently, womxn has been used by intersectional feminists to indicate the same ideas, with explicit inclusion of transgender women and women of color,[3] although some feminists have since indicated that they feel excluded by the term.[citation needed]

Historically, "womyn" and other spelling variants were associated with regional dialects (e.g. Scots) and eye dialect (e.g. African American Vernacular English).[citation needed]
